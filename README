# JS/TS Persistent object

This tiny function provide persistences for json serializable object. It's
possible with using proxy and set/get callbacks. Everytime you mutate the
object, it writes to file with given path. For initialization, file should
contain valid JSON string accroding to schema. Supports deep nested objects.

Implemeted for Deno, but could be adopted for ny engine.

```ts
import { persistent } from "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shevernitskiy/persistent/mod.ts";

const path = "./test/object.json" as const;

type Schema = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  job: {
    salary: number;
  };
};

const state = persistent<Schema>(path); // read json from path and return proxyfied object

state.age = 35; // saved to file!
```
